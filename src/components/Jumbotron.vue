                    This work aims to define the real problems present in the territory under study:
                    an agricultural area of the coastal plain in Emilia-Romagna, between the provinces of Ravenna and
                    Ferrara, south of the Po Delta. <br>
                    This area has already been involved in a LIFE project (LIFE program 2014-2020), called
                    <a href="https://agricoltura.regione.emilia-romagna.it/pubblicazioni/life-agrowetlands-ii-smart-water-and-soil-salinity-management-in-agro-wetlands"
                        target="_blank">
                        "AGROWETLANDS II â€“ Smart water and soil salinity management in agro-wetlands"
                    </a>
                    active from September 2016 to June 2020. <br>
                    The project operated at the farm
                    Agrisfera, partner of the project itself, developing a Decision Support
                    System, called Smart Agrowetlands, dedicated to the management of irrigation in areas
                    subject to water and soil salinization phenomena. <br>
