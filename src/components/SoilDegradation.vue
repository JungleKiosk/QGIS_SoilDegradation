                <p>
                    Soil degradation means a temporary or permanent decrease in the productive capacity of soils caused by
                    geological, geo-morphological and/or anthropic factors (Katyal and Vlek, 2000). <br>
                    About 21% of currently cultivated land has been found to be irreversibly degraded (FAO and ISRIC, 2000).
                    <br>
                    Salinity, sodicity, hydromorphy, soil shallowness, compaction and erosion risk are among the edaphic
                    conditions that increase the risk of soil degradation (FAO and ISRIC, 2000).
